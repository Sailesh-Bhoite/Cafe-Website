#Bhoite's Cafe Website
‚òï An E-commerce Platform for Cafes
This project is a comprehensive full-stack e-commerce website designed for a cafe, allowing customers to browse a menu, add items to a shopping cart, place orders, and generate bills. It also includes an analytics dashboard to track top-selling items.

‚ú® Features
<b>Interactive Menu Display:</b> Browse food and drink items categorized for easy navigation.

<b>PDF Bill Generation:</b> Customers can generate and download a detailed PDF bill for their placed order, including order ID, customer details, and item-wise breakdown.

<b>Sales Data Visualization:</b> An integrated analytics dashboard displays interactive horizontal bar charts (using Plotly) to visualize key sales metrics, such as the "Top N Most Sold Items."

<b>Robust Session Management:</b> Ensures continuity of cart data across different pages.

<b>Database Integration:</b> Utilizes Django's powerful ORM for efficient interaction with a relational database, ensuring reliable storage and retrieval of menu, order, and customer data.

<b>Error Handling & Data Integrity:</b> Includes server-side checks (e.g., for empty carts, missing menu items) and database transactions for data consistency.
