# Bhoite's Cafe Website
## ‚òï An E-commerce Caf√© Platform
This project is a comprehensive full-stack e-commerce website designed for a cafe, allowing customers to browse a menu, add items to a shopping cart, place orders, and generate bills. It also includes an analytics dashboard to track top-selling items.

**Seamless Order Placement:** Finalize and place orders, with all selected items and their details saved into Order and OrderItem database tables for persistent record-keeping.

**PDF Bill Generation:** Customers can generate and download a detailed PDF bill for their placed order, including order ID, customer details, and item-wise breakdown.

**Sales Data Visualization:** An integrated analytics dashboard displays interactive horizontal bar charts (using Plotly) to visualize key sales metrics, such as the "Top N Most Sold Items."

**Robust Session Management:** Ensures continuity of cart data across different pages.

**Database Integration:** Utilizes Django's powerful ORM for efficient interaction with a relational database, ensuring reliable storage and retrieval of menu, order, and customer data.
